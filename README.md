# FTC_DriverControl
Driver Controlled opcodes for FTC robotics.  Starts with First ResQ (2015-2016)
This is the evolving code for the driver controlled mode as used by Juden Ki, the FTC Robotics team 8578.
The 2015/2016 season was a good one for us, and it involved a couple of competitions and 3 or 4 trophies for our trouble.

If you want to use this code for another team, that's what Open Source is all about.  Obviously the software and the hardware are closely related, but hopefully this modular code can be modified and extended to fit a lot of different robots.
